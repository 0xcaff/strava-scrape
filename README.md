# strava-scrape

Strava is the world's largest social fitness platform. It features rich
location and user data (performance, locations and times). This project
aims to scrape segment leaderboards in a geography and provide custom views
upon it. We believe social fitness is a force for bringing people together and
hope to use this to eventually help many more people find running buddies.
